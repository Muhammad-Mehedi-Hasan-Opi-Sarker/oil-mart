As a result of using semantic tags, code codes can now be read exactly. This was not the case before. Semantic tags can be used to understand what is being used here and what is being done.
                As HTML5 is still relatively new, this use of non-semantic elements is still very common on websites today.

                Before working on react that data passing time from parent component to child component had a big problem. If have been parent components has been more child components that time was a big problem. It was a time waste. But our problem solved context API.
